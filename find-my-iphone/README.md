quickly find your missing iPhone (or other Apple device)

## Requirement

brew install node

## Config

1. login icloud web
2. copy some value to alfred-envvironment[clientBuildNumber,clientId,dsid,cookie]
3. set your iCloud apple_id and password(for auto login)

Logging in for the first time is troublesome, but after that, it will automatically log in and update the cookie.
